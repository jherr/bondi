# Bondi Tanstack Start Creator Proto

A think piece on having a template/registry combo to make it easy to build Start apps, as well as add integrations to them after they have been created.

## Install

```shell
pnpm i
```

## Run

```shell
pnpm start
```

This should ask you a couple of questions and result in a new directory being created with a running Tanstack Start app with Tailwind CSS.
